# 🧮 Calculator – HTML, CSS & JavaScript

A simple and clean calculator web application built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.  
This project helps practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic application logic.

This is one of my beginner front-end projects as part of my learning journey.
